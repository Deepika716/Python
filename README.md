# Python

This repository contains a collection of simple and beginner-friendly Python programs created for learning and practice.  
Each file demonstrates a basic programming concept such as arithmetic operations, password generation, and working with APIs.

## Files Included
- **calculator.py** – A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **pwd.py** – A simple password generator that creates random secure passwords.
- **weather.py** – A mini weather application that fetches live temperature data using an open API.

These programs are part of my Python learning journey and will continue to grow as I add more scripts and experiments.
